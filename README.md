Code, final versions, and information on the Sparkfun Graphical Datasheets

This repo includes the Python script used to help generate the graphical datasheets.  It also includes the final .svg, and .pdf files as well as the .csv files use.  The .csv files were used as a starting point and some text did change between the file and the final version.  There is also a User Submitted folder for external contributions.

For more information on the graphical datasheets check out our blog post on them.
